Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a machine learning model for classifying species of Iris flowers. Using the classic Iris dataset, this notebook walks through the process of building and evaluating a classifier to distinguish between three different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

// Project Overview
The main objective is to apply a supervised learning algorithm to accurately classify an Iris flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The project covers all the essential steps, including data loading, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation.

&& Dataset
This project uses the well-known Iris dataset, which is included with the Scikit-learn library.

Description: The dataset contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers. Each class has 50 instances.

Features: It includes four features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Target Variable: The species of the flower, which is the target we aim to predict.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
The machine learning workflow is implemented as follows:

Data Loading and Exploration: The Iris dataset is loaded from Scikit-learn. The data is explored using statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the relationships between features.

Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) to prepare for model training and unbiased evaluation.

Model Training: A classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Support Vector Machine) is trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is measured using its accuracy score on the unseen test data.

Predictive System: A simple function is built to take new measurements as input and predict the corresponding Iris species.

üöÄ Results
The model is evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify the flowers in the test set. Given the distinct nature of the Iris dataset, the model is expected to achieve a high accuracy score (typically above 95%), demonstrating its effectiveness in this classification task.
